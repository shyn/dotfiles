My configuration files. 

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/shyn/dotfiles/master/setup | bash

By default it will install into `~/.dotfiles`. If you prefer a different
location, put it as the first argument. Remember to use absolute path, or path
starting with `~`. No trailing slash!

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/shyn/dotfiles/master/setup | bash ~/.mydots
